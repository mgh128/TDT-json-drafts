# TDT-json-drafts

This repository is for collaborative work transforming the current Tag Data Translation definition files at https://www.gs1.org/standards/epc-rfid/tag-data-translation/current-standard from XML to JSON, for use in an open source implementation of a TDT engine in JavaScript.

At 2021-04-07 the repository only contains manually converted JSON definition files for SGTIN-96 , SGTIN-198 and SSCC-96.
Further testing of these is required before using these as templates for conversion of the other XML definition files for TDT.

To reduce human errors, the plan is that the definition files will all be generated programmatically from a master file of essential parameters per EPC scheme.
